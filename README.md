# Contemporary Issues In Data
In this document, I discussed two articles about T-Mobile's failure to protect its information database and encountered another data breach event in January 2023 after the one that happened in 2021. The frequency of data hacks at T-Mobile is alarming. 

The 2 articles didn't differentiate in criticizing T-Mobile for being careless on database security, but you can see from the contradictory statements made by the spokesmen of T-mobile after the data breach events. I think this issue is important to discuss because it can remind companies of their responsibilities to keep their promise and really provide a safe and secure environment for their clients instead of just giving big talks that they won't deliver.

[T-Mobile Says Hackers Stole Data on About 37 Million Customers in Breach

T-Mobile acknowledged a security lapse of its database in 2021 and about 76.6 million U.S. residents had some sort of records exposed. The intruder claimed that the company’s security practices cleared an easy path for the theft of the data in the database. T-Mobile’s chief executive apologized for the failure and said the company would improve its data safeguards. As part of the settlement, the company also pledged to spend $150 million on security technology in 2022.

This article mentioned how committed T-mobile was to improving its security technology after the data breach in 2021 since it was proved that its database safeguard was fragile. The chief executive acknowledged its failure on database security at this time, which is in stark contrast to what they said after the data breach in 2023.

## Article 2 
[T-Mobile reports another hack, this one impacting 37M accounts](https://www.fiercewireless.com/wireless/t-mobile-reports-another-hack-one-impacting-37m-accounts)

After being hacked by a single Application Programming Interface (API) in 2023, T-Mobile said it understands that an incident like this has an impact on customers and it regrets it. “While we, like any other company, are unfortunately not immune to this type of criminal activity, we plan to continue to make substantial, multi-year investments in strengthening our cybersecurity program,”

Although it took the company three months to admit to the customer information breach (the hacker first retrieved data through the impacted API starting on or around November 25, 2022), T-Mobile has unashamedly excused itself this time, trying to convince consumers that the company was doing its best to improve information security and similar data breach event is unavoidable. I personally think it's really irresponsible of T-Mobile to have a statement like this to "fool" the clients. Obviously, the public can tell that T-Mobile isn't doing its best, and that's also the reason why T- Mobile has become the subject of two proposed federal class actions alleging it was negligent in connection with the incident.

In general, I think the data breach incident and T-Mobile's attitudes can act as a warning to other companies that o keep their promise and really provide a secure database for their clients instead of just giving big talks that they won't deliver. Otherwise, the company's reputation may be ruined and may face lawsuits as well.
